# PYISAC - PYthon InfraStructure As Code

## About

This project will hopefully be a new way to think about configuration management
and application deploment.  It is my hope to design a way to define your infra-
structure in regular python code and use that code to not only perform 
configuration management but also a simple way of deploying applications.

## Installation

```
    sudo pip install virtualenv
